# Analysis of Ultra Potent Synthetic Opioids

This project is a collaborative project between Jess Anand in the Traynor Lab and
the O'Meara lab at the University of Michigan. The goal is to develop a robust
structure activity relationship for nitazene and fentanyl related compounds at the
opioid family GPCRs:

* Re-analysis of Binding and GTPyS assay data by UMich undergrads to build an
  integrative Bayesian model of bioactivity
* Build structural models compounds at the targets using Boltz-2
